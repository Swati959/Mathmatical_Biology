metametabolitites bacterial metametabolitites

based on sequenence we have type and show how much each type is there.

### 1. trend corr between type and metametabolitites

diversity of metametabolitites << host metabolites

age effect and treatmen effect. differential analysis.
vector distance

### 2. confusion matrix of host vs metametabolitites

## ideas

1. compare estimated distribution. and regress similar parts. is it normal?
1. guess dist from data? random sampling?
1. investigate graph clustering.
1. try 1 with visual histograms.

### data

label data is there. others are not normalised numerical.

### meeting?
